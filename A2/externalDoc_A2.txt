*** Executing tests for all the classes ***
- To compile the classes created, Person.java, BasicDoctor.java and Ward.java must be provided, preferably stored in the same folder for easy compilation.
- A testerClass is provided to us, which runs the main method for each of the class we created, in one go.
- The only thing that are outputted if no errors were found will be the toString() method for both Person and Ward Class.
