** EXECUTING CLASSES AND JAR FILE **
- All the of the classes in the commands package has a main function, and are executable 
  through eclipse or console

- The .jar file should be executed using java -jar jarFile name command through a console for
  full functionality (So both console and dialog box interface can be accessed). Jar launches the execute.java
  file's main class.

** ASSIGNMENT STATUS **
- Assignment is in stable condition. No known bugs are found throughout testing proccess. only 4 classes are 
  implemented in both dialog and console interfaces. These commands include:
                    -> assigning patient to bed
                    -> adding new patient to database
                    -> releasing patient out of a bed
                    -> displaying all available beds

- The classes that are not used, are modified so that the program would not crash. HospitalSystem has been converted
  to a Controller class.
