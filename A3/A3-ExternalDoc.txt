**External Documentation for Assignment3**

1) Executing test cases
- The test cases can simply be executed just by running each of the classes'
main() methods, stored within each class.

2) Assignment status
- Based on the test cases I designed, everything seems to work perfectly!
- The Hospital System class is 100% complete, including a prototype of 5 and 7.
- The only class that is not tested, is the HospitalSystem class. Although, this class
can simply be tested by checking the validity of the output!


**List of classes**
- Person Class // Parent Class
    |- Patient Class // Sub-class of Person

- BasicDoctor Class // Parent Class
    |- Doctor Class // Sub-class of BasicDoctor
        |- Surgeon Class // Sub-class of Doctor.

- Ward Class

- HospitalSystem Class

**List of outputs running main methods**
- a tester file is added named Assignment3Tester.java is provided to run all 6 classes; Person, Patient, BasicDoctor, Doctor, Surgeon, Ward.
    |- The output obtained from this run will be the toString() methods ONLY! Any additional outputs beside the toString method will be considered
    |- as a test case failure. The Ward class should only display 2 instances of the .getEmptyBeds(), with the 1st output containing 2 Patients,
    |- and the second containing no Patients.

- For HospitalSystem class, the main class should be run from HospitalSystem.java directly. It prompts inputs from the user.
